# industryDataRun resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.industryData

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an ephemeral run containing data for all subordinate activities executed by the system.

IndustryData automates a Run every 12 hours. Each of these executions is represented by **industryDataRun**. All flows that are active at the time of the Run start are included in the Run.

The individual flows are represented by **industryDataRunActivity**.

_For more information, see [IndustryDataRunActivity](industrydata-industrydatarunactivity.md)._

During a Run the data supplied is validated, bringing in good data to the data lake and flagging bad data. For more information about data validation, see [Validation Rules and Descriptions](/schooldatasync/Validation-rules-and-descriptions.md).

To determine the health of the data, it's passed through data matching and validation rules to help safeguard required and optional data. Good data goes into the data lake. Data that doesn't pass validation is identified as errors or warnings and isn't sent to the Data Lake.

If there were no errors or warnings found, the result of the run will be `completed`.

If there are errors and warnings found, the result of the run will be `completedWithErrors`.

- Error is a record where the required data didn't pass a data matching and/or validation rule and therefore, was removed and not sent to the data lake.

If there are only warnings found, the result of the run will be `completedWithWarnings`.

- Warning is a value on a record where optional data didn't pass a data matching and or validation rule. The value was removed but the record was sent to the data lake.

Status:

- `running`: Actively executing
- `completed`: Completed without any errors or warnings
- `completedWithErrors`: Completed but errors were found
- `completedWithWarnings`: Completed but only warnings were found
- `failed`: Canceled by system

Statistics are available from _[IndustryDataRun-GetStatistics](../api/industrydata-industrydatarun-getstatistics.md)_ to assist with health and monitoring.
